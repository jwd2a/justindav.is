We launched.

That's right - this weekend, we flipped the switch, and you can now [sign up for
CrowdSync][csreg]. Were we ready to launch? Nope, not really. Are we proud of
the current state of the product? Nope, not really.

So, why did we launch? Because *you should launch before you're ready*.

When you're building something new, launch is a mystical thing. People fetishize
launch like it's this massive, important event - a life-changing flip of a switch
that results in (nearly immediate) fame and fortune.

The problem is, that's not how it works. When you launch, usually, not much
happens. If you've built a big pre-sale list, then perhaps you snag a few users
that afternoon. Otherwise, this big milestone comes and goes as quietly as the
rest of your project to date. Building up launch as a huge moment actually does
more harm than good, by drawing an incorrect distinction in the life of your
product, and creating a milestone that inevitably leads to some kind of
disappointment ("We didn't get enough users", "We didn't plan for this scale",
"We forgot to add a support channel of some kind").

Most people wait until things are perfect to launch their products. They want
everything to be as bug-free as possible, for all their favorite features to be
there. That's a nice ideal, but all it means is that you're waiting longer and
longer to see how your product actually works for your potential customers. More
time in the echo chamber means more risk that you're saying the wrong stuff to
yourself about what the market needs. Launching earlier, when you're not ready,
helps to alleviate that, getting people around the product faster, which only
leads to a better product, faster.

People worry about this launch thing way too much. "We can't launch if we're not
ready, people will hate us/curse us on social media/cause a ruckus in our
support center". Fact is, that rarely, if ever, happens. You launch, users
shrug, and you go out to try and make something they actually love. The
longer you wait to get to that point, the longer you risk being wrong, something
a startup doesn't have the luxury of doing.

We need to focus our attention in the right places. Stop worrying about when you
should launch, and instead, start focusing on what kind of feedback you're
getting from your first 10 users. Stop worrying about writing the perfect press
release, and start focusing on [getting out of the building][sblank] and finding
the gap between what you built, and what people want.

Launch parties, countdowns and other launch fetish celebrate the wrong thing.
Launching isn't the goal, building something people love is. Launch when you're
embarrassed, and use that embarrassment to drive you to find that perfect
product as quickly as possible.

Go ahead, [sign up for CrowdSync][csreg]. It doesn't do a ton right now (although,
that's changing by the hour), but you'll be one of the first people we reach out to and
ask what we can build to help you better solve your problems.

Next issue.
