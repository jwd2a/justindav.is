The only goal when building software is to get it in the hands of users. However
you do that more quickly is the challenge. 

If you're a designer, that means communicating to engineering and product the
best way to put together an experience, so it can get built and into the world.

Find the way to do that in the quickest, most lean way possible. 

Maybe you don't need a formal requirements doc.

Maybe you don't need a wireframe.

Maybe you don't need a nicely honed visual comp.

Maybe all you need is a sketch and a quick conversation.
