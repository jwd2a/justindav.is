There are two types of people in the world: default yes people, and default no
people. 

Default yes people look for ways to make things work. They take a challenge, and
approach it with the attitude that it's a puzzle to figure out. They enjoy
getting things to work, pushing boundaries, and taking risks.

Default no people look for ways that things _won't_ work. They look at
schedules, rules, regulation and other ways to support the default no viewpoint.
Everything is difficult and time-consuming, and caution needs to be taken
always. 

Both of these folks are necessary. Without default yes people, we'd never
innovate, we'd never find creative and new ways to push society. Without default
no people, the default yes people would likely drag us into anarchy. They keep
things between the rails, ensure everyone is marching in step. 

When it comes to launching a product, or innovating, which one of these do you
want on your team?
