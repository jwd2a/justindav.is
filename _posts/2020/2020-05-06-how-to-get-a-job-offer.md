If you've ever said to yourself "I wish I could find a job", you need to read
this. 

If you've ever said to yourself "I wish I could find a *better* job", you need
to read this.

Frankly, if you've ever had a job, or ever will, you probably need to read
this.

This is your secret to how to get a job offer. And it's stupid simple.

Just get good at something. 

Honestly, that's it. Get good at something - really good - and let enough people
know you're doing that, and jobs show up.

## Getting Good at Something

Getting good at something is just about working your damn ass off to learn a
skill. That's really it. Pour yourself into something - anything - and get good
at it. 

Interested in sales? Get good at that.
Interested in car repair? Get good at that. 
Interested in puzzles? Get good at that.
Interested in sports? Get good at that.

This isn't hard. Find something you love, that the world also values to some
degree. Pour yourself into it, get good at it. Nights, weekends, spare time -
whatever you have to do. Read, work, play, experiment, volunteer - just find
ways to get better. 

(BTW, know that you suck at first, acknowledge it, be humble, and keep grinding.
You'll get there. We're all horrible at things that other people are incredible
at. That's how the world works.)

## Telling People About It

Honestly, just talk about what you do. Engage in conversations with others in
your industry (who you don't currently work with), and talk about what you're up
to. The challenges, the cool discoveries, the random things. You don't have to
talk about the fact you're learning, you're working on it. Just talk. Make
people know you're interested in _this thing_.

## Get the Job Offer

That's it. Get good at something (this takes time), and talk about it. Repeat.

Think it won't work? [Here's a great example.][twitter][ A designer on Twitter who sadly
lost her job in the COVID-19 situation. She posted about it, and had OVER 300 job offers
- or at least invites - from a litany of big startups who would probably offer 
her even a better job than she had previously.

Here's the point. This is how it works, with almost no exception (nepotism and
grudges notwithstanding). Do the work, get good, let people know, and watch the 
job offers roll in.
