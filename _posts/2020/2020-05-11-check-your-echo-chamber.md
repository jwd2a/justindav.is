Modern technology, particularly social media, has made it easy to construct a
world where everyone else looks and thinks like you. Curated feeds of others
whose opinion you probably agree with more than disagree create an echo chamber
that was never previously possible. 

My wife and I were recently talking about peoples' reaction to COVID-19. She started,
discussing just how many people on Facebook believe it's an overreaction, even a hoax. 
I countered, saying that I hadn't seen much of that at all. 

But she isn't wrong. To her, the world is made up of a lot of folks with one
viewpoint, and to me, the world is made up of the opposite. 

Reality, as it turns out, is only as good as the people around us who create that
reality for us.

The key, then, is to be aware of this bias. Understanding that your worldview is
only as good as the people who you've selected to create that worldview is key
in understanding your own biases about how the world works. 

Remember, this also applies to brands.
