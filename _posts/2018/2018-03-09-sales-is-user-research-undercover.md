When you do a demo or sales call, what's your goal? Closing the deal and getting
the sale, right? Generally, that's going to happen a fraction of the time, due
to the nature of how sales goes.

And, most salespeople will chalk that call up to a failure, or at the very
least, not a good investment of their time.

But there's another way to think of sales calls that turn every single one of
them into incredibly valuable time spent.

**Think of a sales call as user research, and the entire game changes.**

Thinking of a sales call as a user research opportunity changes the entire tenor
of the conversation. Instead of starting by launching into your demo and canned
pitch, you start with questions:

- Tell me about what you do.
- What is difficult about your role?
- You scheduled time for a demo with me. Talk to me about what piqued your
  interest.
- What other solutions are you using today to solve this problem? Where do they
  fall short?

...and so on.

As objections come up, instead of replying with your canned ways around those
objections, ask questions like "So, tell me more about why that's important", so
you can better understand where the need is coming from, and get a richer view
of the people you're speaking with.

It's easy to chalk sales up to being just churn-and-burn calls to try to nail a
close ratio, but it's missing a far more valuable part of the conversation. If
you approach every call thinking of it as an opportunity to _learn_ more about
the person you're talking to, even if they don't become a customer right away,
you'll walk away from every sales call with a victory.
