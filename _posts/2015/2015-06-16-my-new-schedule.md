Our 9-month old has been on a pretty strict schedule since she was born, and the results have been fantastic. She's happy, almost never fussy, slept through the night at 4 weeks, and has overall been an easy baby. Turns out, humans need schedule and rigor. It helps us predict what's coming next, settle into a comfortable routine, and establish patterns that help us keep a balanced life.

Inspired by that, and inspired by conversations with my buddy [Josh](http://www.joshtronic.com), I'm going to get myself on a more rigorous schedule, in order to make sure I accomplish everything I want to, and to help me settled into that same balanced pattern that my daughter has.

Putting together this schedule, there's a few things I wanted to accomplish: I wanted to exercise regularly to increase overall health, wanted to read regularly, and wanted to write regularly. I also wanted to make sure I carved out intentional time for the family, since it's so easy to let that slip on the excuse of "so busy".

So, here's the new schedule:

|  Time  |  Activity  |
|--------|------------|
|7:30-8:00|Exercise|
|8:00-8:15|Cool Down|
|8:15-8:30|Shower|
|8:30-9:00|Read|
|9:00-5:00|Work|
|5:00-5:30|Write|
|5:30-5:45|Plan for the next day|
|5:45-7:30|Family time|
|7:30-8:00|Cook dinner|
|8:00-8:30|Dinner|
|8:30-11:00|Personal projects, extra work, misc free time|

I've put this together to coincide with my daughter's schedule (example: she eats and has her bath from 7:30-8:00pm, so I cook dinner during that time), to maximize the time I can spend with her during the day. Definitely another advantage to her being on a schedule as well.

I think it might be possible to eliminate the 8:00-8:15 cool down time, but jumping in the shower directly after working out tends to result in more sweating, so I think it's a nice bit of time to chill, watch the news, etc. before getting cleaned up.

Overall, this schedule is about making sure I get everything done that I want to do, without absolutely killing myself. It still permits me to sleep pretty late (7:30), while getting all the personal development activities in. Additionally, it keeps me to a 40-hour workweek, which should be ample time to get everything I need to get done, done.

Do you have a schedule you keep yourself to? How is it working for you? What's in you schedule that I missed? Leave it in the comments!
