title: "Start What You Can Build"
---

It's an all-too-common scenario. Someone has a *great* idea, and wants to start a company. Their next question: where can I find someone to make my product? We see this all the time in tech, where someone wants to build an app or site, but isn't technical. This also happens in fashion, where someone has a great idea for a clothing line, but simply can't sew.

There are a few problems with this scenario, and each one of them underscore an important point: if you want to start something, you need to be the person to make it.

### Problem 1: You're Completely Reliant on Others

I know this hurts to hear, but no one cares about your idea nearly as much as you do. When you start something, your passion and intensity is the only thing that will get you through the horrible first part, and if that passion isn't driving the actual creation, it's likely (nay, almost guaranteed) that your thing won't get made at the speed you want or need. Third parties simply won't have the ambition and drive for your project that you do, and your timeline will start to draw out in agonizing weekly chunks.

### Problem 2: You Don't Have the Money 

...and even if you do, you're spending it wrong. When you outsource your product creation to third parties at the inception of your startup, your risk level goes through the roof. It costs *a lot* of money to make things, and chances are, you simply don't have that money to spend. Take an app for example. For a typical mobile app, you might be looking at $30,000 - $50,000 before you've got a decent, polished product. Do you have that cash to plunk down before you're sure this thing will work?

Having the ability to create things yourself means you save most of that money up front, doing two things: giving you more runway to get started (you'll need it, trust me) and reducing total risk while you figure out what the right product should be.

### Problem 3: You're Out of Touch With Your Core Business

Even though the first two on this list are bad, this is undoubtedly the worst. When you start something, you're engaging in a simple act: creating a product or service to solve a problem in the market that you think a lot of people have. When you're unable to make the product or service yourself, you're completely disconnected from the value you're creating, which leaves you at a massive disadvantage to say the least. 

Many great products are created by understanding the limits of the space. In tech, many of the great products we admire are built due to an intimate knowledge of what capabilities the technology has, and how it interacts with people, through first-hand experience building it. When you short yourself that insight, it's likely your ideas will be far more shallow, far less feasible, and frankly, far less likely to change the the world.

### Start Learning

Starting something is exciting, I get it. As soon as you have an idea, you want to run off to the races and get something out into the world. However, take a cue from the successful entrepreneurs of the world: learn how to build what you're starting, and you'll have a deeper, more impactful product that has a far greater chance of success. The road of startups is littered with entrepreneurs who have tried to clever their way out of this, and the fact remains, having the ability to produce is directly tied with your chances of success. 

Go learn to code. Go learn to sew. Go learn to cook. Whatever it is you want to start, learn to make it first, then launch your thing. As our Build Ship Repeat manifesto says, "Ideas Only Belong to Those Who Can Ship".
